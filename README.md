# odin-recipes
My first project through The Odin Project
A small website which displays a landing page and three recipes. 

Learning outcomes:
    1. Folder structure for a simple web-page
    2. HTML boilerplate
    3. Headings, paragraphs, lists (ordered and unordered), images, and links
    4. Commits along with commit comments
    5. Pushing to main

Lessons Identified:
    1. Maintain clean folder structure, keep individual pages and code consistent when possible
    2. Ensure code is correct before commiting, to avoid re-commiting to fix mistakes that could easily have been avoided. e.g. I forgot to add a label for the link to the third recipe
    3. Ensure Commit comments are consistent, perhaps overcommited on the first recipe, and on the last two I just said I added the page
